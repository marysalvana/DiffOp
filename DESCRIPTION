Title: Nonstationary Spatial Cross-Covariance Functions Based 
  on the Differential Operators Approach in 3D
Description: An R package that implements a flexible multivariate 
  nonstationary cross-covariance function model based on the differential 
  operators approach defined in 3-dimensional (3D) space. A defining 
  feature of the model is that it can accommodate nonstationarity in the 
  variances, colocated correlations, and other spatial features of a 
  multivariate Gaussian random field, and is particularly flexible along 
  the vertical dimension. With the implemented cross-covariance function 
  model, users can simulate synthetic multivariate Gaussian random fields. 
  Inference for model parameters is done via maximum likelihood estimation. 
  Predictions at locations with no observations can also be performed.
